# TwitchBot

(Well, the title is kinda misleading since part of it is for Discord...)

Anyway, this is just my code for the chat bot I use for Twitch. Notables features are:
- Replies to basic commands
- A quiz bowl minigame (using the database from QuizDB.org), with a points system
- A joke feature where it can repeat a user's message but replace every adjective with a preset adjective, a verb with another verb, etc.
- Custom greetings for different viewers

It also accepts any generic SQL queries, although only myself and a trusted mod are authorized to do that.
